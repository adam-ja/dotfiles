This software is hereby released into the public domain. That means you can do
whatever you want with it without restriction. See `LICENSE.md` for details.

If you like what you see, feel free to fork it (or just copy any bits you like) but these are my personal configs so I won't be accepting any pull requests unless there's a suggestion I really like and can see being useful for myself.
